## Note about this ebuild
This ebuild seemingly breaks a convention of notifying the user of optional runtime features via calling `optfeature` in `pkg_postinst`, and I have instead made these features installable via USE flags.

While this may be against convention, my preference is that the programs needed for optional runtime functionality be in some way tied to the program for which they are optional dependencies. I feel that pulling optional dependencies via USE flags makes package management easier on the user by providing a clear link between a package that was installed and the package which uses it as an optional dependency
