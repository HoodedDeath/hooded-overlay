## Service files
This package includes Systemd service files for both XML-RPC and WebUI servers (glances.service and glances-web.service respectively), installable by enabling the systemd USE flag. I do not know enough about OpenRC services to write the relavent files and don't have a system running OpenRC to do testing on. If you would like OpenRC services included, feel free to submit service files.
